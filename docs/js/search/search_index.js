--save @am92/aws-s3\n\nEnvironment Variables\nThe following environment variables need to be set to work with this package:\nExample :##### AWS S3 SDK Config\nexport S3_ENABLED='false'\nexport S3_REGION='ap-south-1'\nexport S3_BUCKET=''\nexport S3_PRESIGNED_EXPIRY_IN_SECS='300'\nexport S3_CLOUDFRONT_URL=''Note:\n\nIf 'S3_ENABLED' is set to 'true', 'S3_BUCKET' is required\nVariables where values have been defined can be omitted from being defined as the mentioned values are internally defaulted.\n\n\n\nCreating an OtpSdk Instance\nExample :import { S3Sdk } from '@am92/aws-s3'\n\nconst s3Sdk = new S3Sdk()\nexport default s3SdkIn this case, configuration values are read from environment variables.\nIf you wish to pass your custom 'config' to OtpSdk Class, then you can build it as follows:\nExample :import { S3Sdk } from '@am92/aws-s3'\n\nconst config = {\n  BUCKET: '',\n  PRESIGNED_EXPIRY_IN_SECS: 300,\n  CONNECTION_CONFIG: {\n    region: ''\n  }\n}\n\nconst s3Sdk = new S3Sdk(config)\nexport default s3SdkIn this case, configuration values are defaulted from environment variables. Thus partial config can be passed to the S3Sdk Class.\n\n\nContributors\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          Ankit Gandhi\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          \n          \n          Mehul Agarwal\n        \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nAWS S3 Client\nAWS S3 Request Presigner\n\n\n\nLicense\n\nMIT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2023 Ankit Mehul Team Account\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
